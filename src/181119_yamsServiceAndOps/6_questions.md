## Nice solution... but

![](block.gif)

## Why not docker/k8s?

* Local tests
* YAMS Portal/Frontend already there
* Migration exercise

## Why not a Service Mesh?

## Are you going to opensource it?

* Schibsted contributes to opensource projects
* And also releases
    * See [Schibsted Github organization](https://github.com/schibsted)
* Problem: Not following a "contribute-first" approach
* But already contributed to bimg, zuul, krakenD...
 
## Are you going to offer this SaaS to other companies?
