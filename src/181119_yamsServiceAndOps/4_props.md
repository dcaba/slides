<!--
* Sites were doing already that. 
    * So *saving sites time*
* *Cost effective*
    * SaaS is expensive at Schibsted scale
    * We can build & maintain what we really need
* *Close to the Schibsted sites*
    * not just latency (multiregion setup); also feature-set, compliance...
* But solving *other sites needs*:
    * Storage management
    * Document transformation
    * Video streaming

## High usage

## Effort-less maintenance

* (Almost) No incidents 
* New sites do not require high onboarding efforts

Let's say we dedicate *half an engineer*

<!--
* Stops being competitive
* It quickly becomes legacy
* Disconnects from current business needs

So we try to convince the company it requires, at least, the focus of two engineers

## But oncall rotations

Ok. Let's say 3-4. And we accept an extra project.
