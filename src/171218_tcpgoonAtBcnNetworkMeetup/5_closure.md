## Q&As

## I'd have done the same just with scripting or a fancy tool
Maybe. But goroutines do work very well in this scenario. Plus some research did not bring something effective in front of this specific scenario.

## Where does the project name come from?
```
Goon: /…°uÀên/ noun informal; noun: goon; plural noun: goons ; 
...
2.
NORTH AMERICAN
a bully or thug, especially a member of an armed or security force.
...
```

*Please, do not read it as "TCP-Go-On". Its awful. Very.*

## This is a very dangerous tool
Probably. Knifes are also dangerous. And you can buy knifes. We cannot prevent bad usage.

Worth to say, when executing the tool, an explicit confirmation from the user is required (non-interactive executions require the flag -y/--asume-yes)

## I've been taking a look, and your code sucks...
Probably. We do accept PRs :)

## How many connections can you open from a single client?
Depends on how many connections do you support in your client machine :) . 
No official benchmark/stress test yet, but able to open between 5k-10k without problems from my laptop.

## Can I use the tool now?
Yes. And a public docker image is available to facilitate the job:
```bash
% WHALEBREW_INSTALL_PATH=$HOME/bin whalebrew install dachad/tcpgoon
üê≥  Installed dachad/tcpgoon to /home/caba/bin/tcpgoon
% tcpgoon myhttpsamplehost.com 80 -c 2 -y 
Total: 2, Dialing: 0, Established: 0, Closed: 0, Error: 0, NotInitiated: 2
Total: 2, Dialing: 0, Established: 2, Closed: 0, Error: 0, NotInitiated: 0
--- myhttpsamplehost.com:80 tcp test statistics ---
Total: 2, Dialing: 0, Established: 2, Closed: 0, Error: 0, NotInitiated: 0
Response time stats for 2 established connections min/avg/max/dev = 57.606ms/63.499ms/69.391ms/5.892ms
% echo $?
0
``` 

## What's in your backlog?
See our public issue list in Github. 
In addition to Service Discovery integration (now Eureka), one of the expected big changes is implementing extra "modes":

* Incremental mode, and report first failure (stress)
* Time-restricted execution: a target is defined and execution is successful if it does not time out.

## Is this now part of YAMS' acceptance tests?
Not yet. Stress test ELBs is not the objective, so Service Discovery integration is required (& ongoing).

## Closure...

## The gifts

* When assessing post mortems, do not stop until the very last root cause is clear
* One time solutions suck
* Golang works well for building low level utilities
* Code requires continuous testing. Deliverables too.
* And Golang is easy&fun :)

## Special thanks to...

* chadell, also owning the project
* my wife, who created our gopher

## Further questions?

## Enjoy Christmas!
