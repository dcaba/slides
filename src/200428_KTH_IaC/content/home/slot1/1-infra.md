## IaC and Infrastructure

---

## Distributed systems are here to stay

**And we don't want to manage them "by hand"**

---

**Dynamic infrastructure** was possible in on-premises platforms thanks to:

* Configuration management systems
* Vendors CLIs and APIs
* Virtualization
* Tons of scripting

---

**IaC is not a new concept**

> We previously called that infra automation/orchestration

> Cloud brings big services' portfolios you can compose to build your Internet-scale platform

---

**And a plus: consistency across components**

* Authentication / permissions management (IAM)
* APIs
* SDKs / libs to interact with them

---

But **apps still require a specific infrastructure configuration**

> Also applies to PaaS

---

## And why IaC? Why is it a Devops pillar?

Allows applying the same patterns than apps code
